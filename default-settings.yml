# FeeLLGood default configuration parameters.

# This file documents the default configuration parameters used by
# feeLLGood. It has the format and structure feeLLGood expects from the
# user-supplied configuration file. It can thus be used as a template.
#
# The file format is YAML. Everything after a ‘#’ character is a
# comment. Settings are organized in sections (YAML “objects”) which are
# defined by the indentation, e.g:
#
#   outputs:                # ‘outputs’ section
#     file_basename: foo    # a setting in the ‘outputs’ section
#   mesh:                   # ‘mesh’ section
#     filename: foo.msh     # a setting in the ‘mesh’ section
#     volume_regions:       # a sub-section of ‘mesh’
#       main_volume:        # a sub-section of ‘volume_regions’
#         Ae: 1.5e-11       # a setting in the ‘main_volume’ section
#
# For a short primer on the YAML syntax, see

#
# Some numeric values are unit-less, like the reduced magnetization. All
# other values are in SI units.
#
# Unit vectors need not be of unit length: they will be normalized by
# feeLLGood upon reading the file.

# The ‘outputs’ section defines what data will be saved by feeLLGood,
# and in which files.
outputs:

  # Directory where the output files will be stored. The default value
  # (.) means the working directory where the feeLLGood process is
  # started. If the directory does not exist, it will be created.
  directory: .

  # This string will be used as a prefix for the names of all generated
  # files. Defaults to the base name of the mesh file.
  file_basename:

  # The global quantities listed under ‘evol_columns’ will be saved to
  # the evolution file on this time step.
  evol_time_step: 5e-13

  # Time at which to terminate the simulation.
  final_time: 1e-10

  # Global quantities that should be periodically saved to the evolution
  # file. In addition to the defaults below, the following quantities
  # are also available:
  # - iter: iteration number
  # - dt: time step
  # - max_dm: maximum variation of the magnetization
  # - max_angle: maximum magnetization angle between adjacent nodes
  # - <dMx/dt>: average change rate of Mx
  # - <dMy/dt>: average change rate of My
  # - <dMz/dt>: average change rate of Mz
  # - E_aniso: anisotropy energy
  # - Hx: applied field along x
  # - Hy: applied field along y
  # - Hz: applied field along z
  evol_columns:
    - t         # time
    - <Mx>      # Average value of Mx
    - <My>      # Average value of My
    - <Mz>      # Average value of Mz
    - E_ex      # Exchange energy
    - E_demag   # Demagnetizing energy
    - E_zeeman  # Zeeman energy
    - E_tot     # Total energy

  # How often to save the magnetization configuration. This should be
  # either an integer that is interpreted in units of ‘evol_time_step’,
  # or the keyword ‘false’ which disables the feature.
  mag_config_every: 100

  # Arbitrary set of metadata items, in the form of "key: value" pairs,
