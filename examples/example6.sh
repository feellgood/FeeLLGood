# This example shows how multiple feeLLGood simulations can be run from
# a shell script. The goal is to simulate ferromagnetic resonance on an
# elongated nanoparticle. The sample is a prolate ellipsoid of 8×16 nm,
# with a 1 T/µ₀ magnetization initially along the long (Z) axis. There
# is no DC field. A 4 mT rotating field is applied on the XY plane. The
# frequency of the field is varied in order to find the resonance.

# This must be executed first, before $_ gets clobbered by subsequent
# commands.
