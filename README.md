# FeeLLGood – A micromagnetic solver ![Build Status](https://github.com/feellgood/FeeLLGood/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)

FEELLGOOD is a micromagnetic solver using finite element technique to integrate Landau Lifshitz Gilbert equation. It computes the demagnetizing field using the so-called fast multipole algorithm.

It is developped by JC Toussaint & al.
The code is being modified without any warranty it works. A dedicated website can be found [here][]  
We recommand to use branch master, other branches are experimental or work in progress.
